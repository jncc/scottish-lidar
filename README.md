Scottish Remote Sensing Portal
==============================

The [Scottish Remote Sensing Portal](https://remotesensingdata.gov.scot/) is designed, developed and supported by JNCC.

> The repository is named `scottish-lidar` for historical reasons.

Development
-----------

Please enable [EditorConfig](https://EditorConfig.org) before you do anything else. For VS Code, install the extension.

Create an `.env` file by copying `.example.env`.

You'll need Node (version v18), with Yarn installed.

    yarn      # install packages
    yarn dev  # build and run a development server

...but please read on about Parcel.js!

Parcel.js
---------

Parcel.js is great, but so far has very basic support for multi-page web applications.

(1) Due to [this issue](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/1315) you'll need to open your browser manually at

    http://localhost:4000/index.html  <-- note the `index.html`

In production, the `.html` extension isn't needed. Github Pages serves `.html` (and `index.html`) automatically.

This means we need a workaround for ugly local development URLs. Variables are appended to page URLs so that in-app links work at development time:

    PAGE_EXTENSION=".pug"
    INDEX_PAGE=index

These variables are both set to the empty string in production, and HTML links are constructed like so:

    a(href='/about' + process.env.PAGE_EXTENSION) Go to the About page
        ->  /about       # prod
        ->  /about.pug   # dev

    a(href='/' + process.env.INDEX_PAGE + process.env.PAGE_EXTENSION) Go to the home page
        ->  /            # prod
        ->  /index.pug   # dev

(But note that Parcel of course *then* converts .pug templates into .html files!)

(2) Due to [this bug](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/2340) each page currently has its own bundle. This could be improved significantly in the future - only three bundles are really needed; one for the static pages, one for the single-page React app, and one shared bundle.

If something breaks after a change (especially of `.env` values), **clear the Parcel cache**.

    yarn clean   # cleans all build output, including the Parcel cache

Database
--------

See the `jncc/catalog` repository. You can run a full local instance of the database and API with Docker. üê≥

Launch a database instance with an API and check `http://localhost:6080/alive`.

Code style, testing and building
--------------------------------

Ensure your code passes the TSLint style rules. Jest is the test framework, and has a nice interactive runner which you can leave running in a console.

    yarn test:watch

To avoid failures at the build server, run the production build pipeline before pushing.

    yarn build

Tips
----

Upgrade all library packages to their latest versions with

    yarn upgrade --latest

You can install the `parcel-plugin-bundle-visualiser` package to create a visual report on bundle size. Build without source maps so they don't confuse matters, and view the output file in `dist/report.html`.

    yarn build --no-source-maps

Don't commit this change or you'll end up with `report.html` in the production build.

Deployment
----------

The site is automatically deployed to Github Pages by Jenkins using the script in `deploy/`. You can see the currently deployed build in the custom `x-version` meta tag at the top of the HTML pages, with the format `{build-number}.{git-commit}` . For example,

    <meta name="x-version" content="43.320b45076e0c0ffc3016944f66754f32af85a6cf">

It is possible to deploy the site without Jenkins by manually following the command line steps in the relevent Jenkinsfile. Essentially, you need to force push to the `gh-pages` branch of the relevent repository. You need to ensure that all the required environment variables are set during the build, e.g.

    INDEX_PAGE="" PAGE_EXTENSION="" CATALOG_API_ENDPOINT="https://beta-srsp-ows.jncc.gov.uk" AGGREGATE_LAYER_BASE_URL="https://beta-srsp-ows.jncc.gov.uk.uk/scotland/wms" yarn build

Page structure
--------------

The web application consists of several html "content" pages plus a page that holds a single-page React app. It has been designed carefully to be hosted in production on a "static" web host. There is no dynamic web server, and we make do with direct client-side calls to the JNCC Catalog database API.

    - /                         - home page       (index.html)
    - /data                     - the react app   (data.html)
    - /data#/list                   - the list screen
    - /data#/list?lidar/phase-1     - the list screen, filtered
    - /data#/map                    - the map screen
    - /data#/download               - the download screen
    - /about                    - about page      (about.html)
    - /contribute               - contribute page (contribute.html)
    - /cookies                  - cookies page    (cookies.html)
    - /privacy                  - privacy page    (privacy.html)
    - /404                      - 404 page        (404.html)

Note that we use the react-router `HashRouter` to ensure the app behaves itself in a static hosting environment. You can navigate directly to deep links and refresh the browser within the app because the static `data.html` page will be (re)fetched from the server, allowing the the client-side router to then take over.

Data model and server-side API
------------------------------

We expose the existing "Catalog" database API on the Internet, removing the need for any backend web server or cloud functions. This also creates the possibility of a significant future deliverable.

The Catalog database has two basic concepts: *collections* and *products*. In this application, a collection is a *dataset*, visualized with a *layer* on the map.

Get all collection metadata (for `scotland-gov`):

    GET search/collection/scotland-gov/*

- `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1/dsm`
- `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1/dtm`
- `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1/laz`
- `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-2/dsm`
- `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-2/dtm`
- etc...

There are currently 9 collections, so an assumption of the app design is that this collection metadata can fit into memory easily and be fetched in one request. We'll keep this collection in memory, as it's used by both the list screen and the map sidebar.

Collections are filterable by *group* in the list screen, e.g.

- `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1`
- `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-2`
- `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-3`

Collections are also grouped in the map screen in the same way, e.g.

- lidar/phase-1 (*group*)
  - dsm `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1/dsm` (*collection*)
  - dtm `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1/dtm`
  - laz `scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1/laz`

Clearly we need a helper function `parseCollectionName(collectionName: string): ParsedCollectionName`, where:

    interface ParsedCollectionName {
        Owner:   string  // `scotland-gov`
        Group:   string  // `lidar/phase-1`
        Dataset: string  // `dsm`
    }

One oddity is that the OGC WMS service URLs for the collections are stored as products (in a separate, special collection). We'll have to join them on the client.

    POST search/product
    {
        "collections": "scotland-gov/lidar/ogc"
    }

This query gives a list of OGC products which we can identify using the product name:

`scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1/dtm` for this collection...  
`scotland-gov-lidar-phase-1-dtm` the OGC product has a corresponding product name

The List page can also be filtered to e.g. a group by querystring value e.g. `lidar/phase-1`.
This is client-side filter of the collections lookup. (As an aside, the server-side alternative would be `GET search/collection/scotland-gov/lidar/phase-1/*`)

The map screen needs to know which collections are currently matching bbox:

    POST search/product/countByCollection
        {
            footprint
            spatial-op
            [collection1, collection2]
        }
Returns [(collection-name, count)]

Note: We need to send all collections from the in-memory collection list.

Future home page summary stats?
Could use collectionscontainingproducts with the maximal bounding box to get all collections and their product count.
