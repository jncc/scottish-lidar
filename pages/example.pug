        | Accurate and reliable wind field measurement for wind turbine wake is an important foundation of design and operation of the wind farms. Owing to its high spatial resolution and comparatively low economic cost, Doppler-based wind LiDAR has been widely applied to wind field monitoring. However, the turbine wake wind field often shows strong variability and complexity in both spatial and temporal aspects, that the conventional wind LiDAR may lack the temporal resolution of wind retrievals for imaging the fast-changing wind field, and the spatial resolution to quantitative reveal the detailed turbine wake wind field. Therefore, this project aims to develop a novel approach for fast-imaging high resolution turbine wake wind field monitoring based on Doppler-based wind LiDAR system.

        | A novel line of sight (LOS) data up-sampling and unsynchronized dual LiDAR wind retrieval method are developed to improve the temporal and spatial resolution of the wind field, which consists of two steps. Step 1 is the acquisition, registration and up-sampling of the LOS data. The two LOS datasets obtained from an unsynchronized dual LiDAR system will be aligned into pre-set grids, then been up-sampled based on the low-rank matrix completion method. Step 2 is the wind field regularization and retrieval, which designs spatial regularization for 2D horizontal wind field, then applies a robust reconstruction algorithm for wind retrieval.
